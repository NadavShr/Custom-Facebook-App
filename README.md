A custom app of Facebook.
Developed with C#, seperating Client side and Server side.

### The app gives a minor "Facebook experience" and 2 extra fitchers not available on the regular facebook app:
# 1. Slide show
Loading the user's albums and by selecting one of them, the album's photos start showing one by one.
The user can change the speed of the changing images.

# 2. Page filter
Loading and showing all of the liked pages of the user. The user can add a new category to filter by the pages.
